# TicketSea

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started:

1. Clone repository. Open containing folder and run in terminal:
### `npm start`

2. In new terminal, navigate to hardhat folder. Run the following to spawn test accounts:
### `npx hardhat node`

3. Once new accounts are created, navigate to localhost:3000 to view app and functionality. Use Metamask to connect to localhost and import accounts via private keys obtained in step 2. Use these accounts to test listing assets and buying.
